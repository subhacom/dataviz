What module for plotting?

- Abandoning PyQwt, which seems to be an abandoned project.

- Matplotlib - does not fit very well into PyQt (the programming
  styles conflict).

- PyQtGraph seems to be the only candidate.
 
- VisPy is still under heavy development and as of 2015-08-08 is very
  OpenGL focused. Hoping that it will be incorporated smoothly into
  PyQtGraph in the future.
