* DONE What module for plotting?				   :PLOTTING:
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-21 Fri 19:07]

  - Abandoning PyQwt, which seems to be an abandoned project.

  - Matplotlib - does not fit very well into PyQt (the programming
    styles conflict).

  - PyQtGraph seems to be the only candidate.
 
  - VisPy is still under heavy development and as of 2015-08-08 is
    very OpenGL focused. Hoping that it will be incorporated smoothly
    into PyQtGraph in the future.

  - PyQtGraph stable version does not support PyQt5 support, using
    devel branch from github.

* TODO Choice of plotting multiple datasets on same plot widget	   :PLOTTING:
  Cannot attach to a specific dataset. Update `name` with something
  more meaningful. Allow option of plotting on new widget or current
  widget (Alt+p, Alt+Shift+p).

* TODO Plot multidimensional dataset				   :PLOTTING:
  Provide choice of rows/columns for multidimensional datasets when
  plotting.
