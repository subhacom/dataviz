* DONE What module for plotting?				   :PLOTTING:
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-21 Fri 19:07]

  - Abandoning PyQwt, which seems to be an abandoned project.

  - Matplotlib - does not fit very well into PyQt (the programming
    styles conflict).

  - PyQtGraph seems to be the only candidate.
 
  - VisPy is still under heavy development and as of 2015-08-08 is
    very OpenGL focused. Hoping that it will be incorporated smoothly
    into PyQtGraph in the future.

  - PyQtGraph stable version does not support PyQt5 support, using
    devel branch from github.

* TODO Choice of plotting multiple datasets on same plot widget	   :PLOTTING:
  Cannot attach to a specific dataset. Update `name` with something
  more meaningful. Allow option of plotting on new widget or current
  widget (Alt+p, Alt+Shift+p).

* TODO Plot multidimensional dataset				   :PLOTTING:
  Provide choice of rows/columns for multidimensional datasets when
  plotting.

* Zooming in mousemode 1 hangs in mouseMoveEvent on cygwin64
  After selecting Mouse mode 1 from context menu in a PlotWidget when
  I try to zoom into a rectangular region, the window
  freezes. Keyboard interrupt on he terminal gives:

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/pyqtgraph/widgets/GraphicsView.py", line 360, in mouseMoveEvent
      def mouseMoveEvent(self, ev):
    KeyboardInterrupt

  Interestingly, standalone plotwidget works. One embedded in a
  QMdiSubWindow poses the problem.  This occurs with devel branch with
  PyQt5/python3.4 installed on cygwin64 (latest) on Windows 7. Works
  fine with Anaconda on the same system.
