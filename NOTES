* DONE What module for plotting?				   :PLOTTING:
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-21 Fri 19:07]

  - Abandoning PyQwt, which seems to be an abandoned project.

  - Matplotlib - does not fit very well into PyQt (the programming
    styles conflict).

  - PyQtGraph seems to be the only candidate.
 
  - VisPy is still under heavy development and as of 2015-08-08 is
    very OpenGL focused. Hoping that it will be incorporated smoothly
    into PyQtGraph in the future.

  - PyQtGraph stable version does not support PyQt5 support, using
    devel branch from github.

* TODO Choice of plotting multiple datasets on same plot widget	   :PLOTTING:
  Cannot attach to a specific dataset. Update `name` with something
  more meaningful. Allow option of plotting on new widget or current
  widget (Alt+p, Alt+Shift+p).

* DONE Plot multidimensional dataset				   :PLOTTING:
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-08-24 Mon 18:37]
  Provide choice of rows/columns for multidimensional datasets when
  plotting.

** The control over data source is getting unwieldy.
   - 1D data:
	 - simple  x=index, y=data or the other way round
	 - compound x=index, y=column or the other way round
   - 2D data:
	 - data in rows: x=column 1, y=column 2
	 - data in cols: x=row 1, y= row 2
   - N-D data
	 - data in k-th dimension, x=data[d0, d1, d_{k-1}, :, d_{k+1}, ..., d_{N-1}), y=data[d'0, d'1, d'_{k-1}, :, d'_{k+1}, ..., d'_{N-1}]
	   where d_{i} is the index on dimension i
	   e.g., N=3, data in Z (k=2), x=data[Xx, Yx, :], y=data[Xy,Yy, :]
	   either of these can also be the index.
	
* TODO Plot compound dataset 	
  - It will be useful to plot data against column names. For example,
    if each column corresponds to a year.

* TODO Add control for configuring line style, color etc.
* Zooming in mousemode 1 hangs in mouseMoveEvent on cygwin64
  After selecting Mouse mode 1 from context menu in a PlotWidget when
  I try to zoom into a rectangular region, the window
  freezes. Keyboard interrupt on he terminal gives:

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/pyqtgraph/widgets/GraphicsView.py", line 360, in mouseMoveEvent
      def mouseMoveEvent(self, ev):
    KeyboardInterrupt

  Interestingly, standalone plotwidget works. One embedded in a
  QMdiSubWindow poses the problem.  This occurs with devel branch with
  PyQt5/python3.4 installed on cygwin64 (latest) on Windows 7. Works
  fine with Anaconda on the same system.

* TODO keep just one parameter tree visible 
  and update it depending on which plotwidget is selected. Also use
  tabs in stead of horizontal display.
