dataviz is a utility for viewing HDF5 datasets.

It was developed for analyzing neuronal simulation data saved in a
custom format. But the interface is generic enough to display simple
HDF5 files. The tools are totally for neuronal data analysis. But the
plan is to make it a more general tool.

This is a rewrite of the old code. Replacing PyQwt with PyQtGraph (or
some other module).

It uses  Python 3.x, numpy, PyQt5, h5py.

Starting from scratch with new language and libraries.
