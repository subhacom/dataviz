dataviz is a utility for viewing HDF5 datasets.

It was developed for analyzing neuronal simulation data saved in a
custom format. But the interface is generic enough to display simple
HDF5 files. The tools are totally for neuronal data analysis. But the
plan is to make it a more general tool.

This is a rewrite of the old code. Replacing PyQwt with PyQtGraph (or
some other module).

It uses  Python 3.x, numpy, PyQt5, h5py.

Starting from scratch with new language and libraries.


TODO 
----
Important features to port from old code:

     HDF5 Attribute display

     Plotting

     Filtering

     Selection by regular expression

     Python shell


Not handling in near future
---------------------------
Nested datasets. Datasets with entries that are variable length
arrays.

Images? Need to have a look at existing standards.
