Description: \ 
        dataviz is a utility for viewing HDF5 datasets.
        
        It was developed for analyzing neuronal simulation data saved in a
        custom format. But the interface is generic enough to display simple
        HDF5 files. The tools are totally for neuronal data analysis. But the
        plan is to make it a more general tool.
        
        This is a rewrite of the old code. Replacing PyQwt with PyQtGraph (or
        some other module).
        
        It uses  Python 3.x, numpy, PyQt5, h5py, PyQtGraph.
        
        Written from scratch in Python 3.
